## 🚀 Running the Application

If you'd like to see it in action:

```r
# Install dependencies
install.packages(c("shiny", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "plotly", 
                   "stringr", "tidyverse", "jsonlite", 
                   "shinythemes", "showtext"))

# Run the app
shiny::runApp("app2026.R")
```

**Note**: Requires R 4.0+ and valid data files
